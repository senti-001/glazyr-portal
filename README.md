# Neural Chromium Website

This repository hosts the official website for the **Neural Chromium** project, serving as the primary public-facing portal.

## Project Vision
Neural Chromium is an agentic web runtime built for AI agents, powered by Chromium, NATS JetStream, and Python. Its core purpose is to enable programmatic control and high-throughput interaction with the web for AI-driven workflows.

## Key Features & Goals
*   **Agentic Web Runtime:** Designed from the ground up for programmatic control by AI agents.
*   **Chromium Core:** Leverages the robust Chromium engine for complete web standards support.
*   **NATS JetStream Backbone:** Enables high-performance, distributed messaging between agents and the browser.
*   **Python Integration:** Provides a familiar scripting interface for agent developers.
*   **Showcase Development:** Present project progress, build status, and architectural details.
*   **Onboard Developers:** Offer quickstart guides and overview of the project.

## Getting Started

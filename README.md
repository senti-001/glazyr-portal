# Glazyr Viz: Industrial Infrastructure Hub

This repository hosts the official technical portal for **Glazyr Viz**, serving as the decentralized command center for the ecosystem's infrastructure and development.

Glazyr Viz is an agentic web runtime built for AI agents, powered by a customized Chromium fork and the **Phoenix Protocol**.

## Industrial Hub Status [NC-HUB-001]
- **Network Status**: **STANDBY** // Initiating GCP Credit Pulse.
- **Primary Builder**: **Big Iron (GCP)** // Node: `136.113.105.70`.
- **Architecture**: Tri-Core (SentiLabs06 / Claw / OpenClaw).

## Key Features & Goals
*   **Infrastructure Transparency**: Real-time visualization of build status and node health.
*   **Module Bounty Board**: Decentralized task management for core vision and economic primitives.
*   **Phoenix Protocol Specs**: Detailed documentation on the agentic resilience and decoupling layers.
*   **Developer Onboarding**: Specialized guides for MCP and ZCV integration.

## Getting Started
Clone the master runtime to begin:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/senti-001/glazyr-viz.git
```

## Security & Agenticty
